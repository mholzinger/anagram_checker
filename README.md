# anagram checker

Anagram Checker written in C
--

Problem: Write a program that checks against two strings to see if one is an anagram of the other.

- I wrote this solution today in a code screen and ran out of time getting things to compile.

- If this gets seen, I cleaned it up and can go take a walk now.

- I had fun too :)


to run:

```
clang anagram.c
./a.out
```

ie: 
`Are strings <race>, <care>, anagrams? : True`
